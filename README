Hello,

Thanks for using Y.A.S.A.T.

1 PRESENTATION

    YASAT (Yet Another Stupid Audit Tool) is a simple stupid audit tool.
    Its goal is to be as simple as possible with minimum binary dependencies (only sed, grep and cut)
    Second goal is to document each test with maximum information and links to official documentation.

    It do many tests for checking security configuration issue or others good practice. 
    You may think that some test is pedantic, useless or too paranoiac, sorry for that, it is just my point of view of I want to check.

    Don't forget that YASAT is not the only audit tool,
    you can also use tiger, lynis, sectool, nessus, openvas, Debian's checksecurity, etc... for checking your systems


2 INSTALLATION, CONFIGURATION

    Dependencies: sed, cut, grep. YASAT will use also openssl for some tests.
    Latest version can be found at http://yasat.sourceforge.net

    2.1 On-my-home installation
	Simply untar the yasat tarball
	tar xvzf yasat-version.tar.gz

	Change directory to yasat directory
	cd yasat

	and type ./yasat for having the list of options.

    2.2 On the FS installation
	Just do make install
	and type yasat

    You can configure override some variable of yasat by using /etc/yasat/yasat.conf or /usr/local/etc/yasat/yasat.conf or ~/.yasat/yasat.conf (Priority in this order)
    Example 1: if you are under Linux kernel and dont have compiled CONFIG_IKCONFIG_PROC, you can provided .config through YASAT_PATH_TO_KERNEL_CONFIG .
    Example 2: You can give to YASAT the path to a manual installation of apache through POSSIBLE_APACHE_CONFIG_LOCATION .

3 USAGE

    For standard test, type ./yasat -s


4 PATCHS, CRITICS

    Patch, contributions, critics ( even bad:) ) are welcome.
    You can mail me at clabbe.montjoie@gmail.com with, and if possible, a subject beginning by [YASAT].
    You can also perhaps find me on channel #yasat on Freenode IRC servers.


5 CONTENTS, PLUGIN WRITING
    (TO FINISH)

    ./tests/
    In this directory, you will find all scripts for testing yasat (non regressions, etc... )

    ./plugins/
    In this directory, you will find plugins.
    A plugin is segmented in 3 files:
	plugin.test		: All test to do for this plugin
        plugin.data		: All data necessary for the plugin (ex: all directives to check )
	plugin.advice		: List of advice for each check made by the plugin

    For writing plugins you have many functions at your disposal
    	get_simple_right()
	get_full_right()
	get_path_from_apache_directives()
	check_file()
	check_directory_group()
	check_directory_others()
	check_directory_writable_by_group()
	FindValueOf()
	FindValueOfEqual()
	FindValueOfDDot()
	CheckPresenceOf()
	Title()

	For referencing tests done by YASAT, now use the following comment.
	Put external reference like PCIDSS RedHat compliance etc...
	#CCE http://cce.mitre.org/lists/cce_list.html
	#YASAT_TEST_name_of_test [RH=xxx] [PCIDSS=xx] [CCEID=xxx] [NSAG=xxx] description of the test
